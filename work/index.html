        <h6>A&I Program Manager: 5.18 - 7.18</h6>
      </div>
      <p>Working as a program manager in the Accounts and Idnentities train of Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE) was an amazing experience during the summer before my senior year at Cal. I was given the opportunity to drive a project dealing with the development and delivery of an API that would assist our game developer partners with GDPR compliance. The experience here was very unique in that I needed to pick up the projects I was helping with very quickly as deadlines and deliverables lined up within the first handful of days. SIE also put me through SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework) 4.0 training which really helped to lay foundations for me to understand the development cycle and the processes that program managers facilitate to ensure successful and healthy development. Another awesome aspect of this job was that I needed to communicate with a wide range of people (engineers, legal, finance, executives, etc.) from both the U.S. and Japan. The big challenge came with being able to juggle multiple tasks simultaneously and keep a clear head while talking with all these different people.</p>
      <p>Among all of the things I learned while working at PlayStation, among the most important and lasting would be how to communicate with a wide range of people with different backgrounds and also to never assume anything when it comes to communication. This summer was even more unqiue in the fact that it was the first internship where I didn't touch any codebase. While this did mean I didn't get a change to up my coding game, I honed other skills that would be important for me in the professional world, especially if I am begining to venture out of the role of an engineer.</p>

      </div>
      <p>Starting in May 2016, I worked as a software engineer intern for SAP Labs in Palo Alto helping to develop and update the QA team's Java-based, automated testing framework. To aid in the testing of SAP's BI Information Steward web application, I also expanded the team's framework using Apache JMeter, which allows me to build framework at a much faster rate and speed up individual testcases by up to 50%. </p>
      <p>In June of 2017, I had the opportunity to return to SAP as a both a project manager and software engineer intern. </p>

        <h6>Car Enthusiast: 2.16 - 6.16</h6>
      </div>
      <p>Driving, ahem, working at Shift was arguable one of the most exciting and fast-paced experiences I've ever had the pleasure of being a part of. While quite phsyically demanding spending the entire day driving around the bay and delivering test drives to potential buyers, it was quite rewarding to be surrounded by people with a common passion for cars and to experience front end sales for the first time in my life without any formal training.</p>

      <p>For this project, I worked with Anthropology PhD Sangin Kim at UCSB and used object-oriented programming and agent-based simulation with R to model group selection by dispersion and cultural processes. In this model, there were positive and negative influencers that would interact with each other via a point based system throughout their lifetime and have offspring who would continue this process for multiple generations. The applications of this study reflect ideal group sizes given certain starting parameters for work, study, and more!</p>
