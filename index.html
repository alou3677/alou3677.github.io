      <h4>a quick introduction to who I am</h4>
      <div class="about-1">
        <p>First of all, thank you for checking out my page! It's been a side project of mine to maintain this personal portfolio since I've finished my sophomore year at Cal and I hope it gives you a better picture of who I am. I am currently a junior at UC Berkeley studying both Economics and Computer Science and exploring topics of project management, artificial intelligence companions, and entrepreneurship.</p>

        <p>During the summer and fall of 2017, I will be working as a Software QA Engineer and Project Management intern for SAP Labs in Palo Alto. In the past, I've also worked as a front-end salesman for the young, used-car startup Shift Technologies. If you want to learn more about the professional work I've done, scroll down to my work and projects outline below! </p>

        <p>When I'm not in the office or classroom, it's likely that you'll find me in the gym or in the water. Weather and work permitting, there's also a good chance I'll be tackling the slopes in Tahoe with a pair of skiis. And as my photo gallery below will show, I also have a passion for automobiles, shoes, photography, and travelling.</p>

        <br />
        <p>Starting in May of 2016 after finishing my freshman year at Cal, I was interning as a software engineer for SAP Labs in Palo Alto, California. The overall description of the job was to help develop and update the testing framework that the QA team already had in place for SAP's Business Objects Information Steward web application.</p>
        <br />
        <p>When I joined, 99% of the team's testing framework was based on Java code that was called upon via shell scripts to send requests to an Information Steward server, allowing us to execute a large number of testcases with ease.</p>
        <br />
        <p>My tasks consisted of updating "goldlog" files with which we compared test run outputs against to verify expected behavior throughout patches and new releases and creating the shell scripts that would run a suite of testcases.</p>
        <br />
        <p>However, the most powerful tool I've learned to use at SAP is Apache JMeter. While built for load lesting web applications, JMeter is also extremely useful for the automation of web requests. Using JMeter, I have been able to expand our team's testing framework at a much faster rate with JMeter's built-in templates and increase our testing performance for JMeter-based testcases by up to 50% with less web requests and high-performance JSON output parsing.</p>

        <p>Driving, ahem, working at Shift was arguable one of the most exciting and fast-paced experiences I've ever had the pleasure of being a part of. While quite phsyically demanding spending the entire day driving around the bay and delivering test drives to potential buyers, it was quite rewarding to be surrounded by people with a common passion and the feeling whenever I, the youngest member of the team at age 18, was able to land a sale.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Being a small startup with every member of the team always having something on their hands, I had to learn fast on my own and pick up soft skills along with my own workflow rhythm as I dived into full-time duties without even completing their planned, formal training.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Aside from learning how it feels to drive a slick, manual Porsche 911 and monsterous Range Rover Sport during my part-time stint based out of South San Francisco, I also learned how to tackle front-end sales for the first time. By the end of my time at Shift, I had finished with about a 30% closing rate.</p>
