          <p>First of all, thank you for checking out my page! It's been a side project of mine to maintain this personal portfolio since I've finished my sophomore year at Cal and I hope it gives you a better picture of who I am!<br /><br />I am currently a junior at UC Berkeley studying both Economics and Computer Science exploring topics of project management, AI companions, and entrepreneurship. Scroll down to check out my work experience, projects, and hobbies!</p>

          </div>
          <p>Starting in May 2016, I have worked as a software engineer intern for SAP Labs in Palo Alto helping to develop and update the QA team's Java-based, automated testing framework. To aid in the testing of SAP's BI Information Steward web application, I have also expanded the team's framework using Apache JMeter, which allows me to build framework at a much faster rate and speed up individual testcases by up to 50%. </p>

          <p>Driving, ahem, working at Shift was arguable one of the most exciting and fast-paced experiences I've ever had the pleasure of being a part of. While quite phsyically demanding spending the entire day driving around the bay and delivering test drives to potential buyers, it was quite rewarding to be surrounded by people with a common passion for cars and to experience front end sales for the first time in my life without any formal training.</p>

          <p>For this project, I worked with Anthropology PhD Sangin Kim at UCSB and used object-oriented programming and agent-based simulation with R to model group selection by dispersion and cultural processes. In this model, there were positive and negative influencers that would interact with each other via a point based system throughout their lifetime and have offspring who would continue this process for multiple generations. The applications of this study reflect ideal group sizes given certain starting parameters for work, study, and more!</p>

          <h5>Fashion Footwear: BOOST</h5>
          <p>In the summer of 2016, my friend introduced me to the world of hype-fashion sneakers during the big Adidas NMD drop in June. After I had copped my first pair of NMD_R1 Reflectives, my afinity for 'athleisure' sportswear has exploded and left me with my own personal collection of NMDs, UltraBoosts, and Yeezys alongside a great portfolio of sneaker photography as well!</p>

          <h5>Automotive Culture: VOLVO</h5>
          <p>Mom's 2002 Volvo S40, my high school 2012 Volvo S60 T5, and now a 2015 Volvo S60 T5 AWD. I think it's safe to say that Volvo has been in my life for a very, very long time. While I'm passionate about all sorts of cars from dirty-road rally legends like the Delta S4 to the track-ready McLaren 675LTs and P1 GTRs, Volvos have always had a special place in my heart.</p>

          <h5>Competitive Swimming</h5>
          <p>I've been swimming for over 80% of my life, and of that about half has been dedicated to swimming competitively on my year-round club team, the California Dolphin Swim Team based out of Fremont, CA. In high school, I may have taken swimmiing more seriously than my actual studies, but I learned a great deal from the pool and did end up with Sectionals cuts (bonus pts for you if you know what this means) for my best sprint freestyle events. </p>

          <h5>Downhill Skiing</h5>
