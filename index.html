        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <h4>A quick introduction to who I am</h4>
        <p>   First, of all, thank you for taking the time to come check out my page. It's been a small side project of mine to maintain this personal portfolio since I've finished my sophomore year at Cal and I hope it gives you a better picture of who I am!</p>
        <p>   So you already know that I went to Cal for my undergrad studies, and as of now, I am still a sophomore studying both Economics and Computer Science. For the summer and fall of 2017, I am also currently working as a Software QA Engineer and Project Management intern for SAP Labs in Palo Alto.</p>
        <p>   With regards to my pre-college life, I graduated from Moreau Catholic High School in Hayward top of my class in 2015 but spent much of my time before college in the pool training with my club team, the California Dolphin Swim Team, which is now part of the East Bay Aquatic Association. Swimming was what I invested a great deal of my time in and what played a significant role in the development of both my physical and mental strength.</p>
