      <h5>Fashion Footwear: BOOST</h5>
      <p>In the summer of 2016, my friend introduced me to the world of hype-fashion sneakers during the big Adidas NMD drop in June. After I had copped my first pair of NMD_R1 Reflectives, my afinity for 'athleisure' sportswear has exploded and left me with my own personal collection of NMDs, UltraBoosts, and Yeezys alongside a great portfolio of sneaker photography as well!</p>

      <h5>Automotive Culture: VOLVO</h5>
      <p>Mom's 2002 Volvo S40, my high school 2012 Volvo S60 T5, and now a 2015 Volvo S60 T5 AWD. I think it's safe to say that Volvo has been in my life for a very, very long time. While I'm passionate about all sorts of cars from dirty-road rally legends like the Delta S4 to the track-ready McLaren 675LTs and P1 GTRs, Volvos have always had a special place in my heart.</p>

      <h5>Competitive Swimming</h5>
      <p>I've been swimming for over 80% of my life, and of that about half has been dedicated to swimming competitively on my year-round club team, the California Dolphin Swim Team based out of Fremont, CA. In high school, I may have taken swimmiing more seriously than my actual studies, but I learned a great deal from the pool and did end up with Sectionals cuts (bonus pts for you if you know what this means) for my best sprint freestyle events. </p>

      <h5>Downhill Skiing</h5>
      <p>Snow, speed, and scenery. I'm not sure what else you could be asking for in the winter season, but that's is all I need to enjoy the mountains. </p>

      <h5>Photography</h5>
